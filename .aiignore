# This file specifies patterns for files and directories that the AI assistant
# should ignore when performing codebase analysis, searches, or listings.
# Patterns should be standard glob patterns (e.g., `*.log`, `temp_dir/`).

# Default patterns (like .git, venv, node_modules, build, dist) are often
# already ignored by the system, but you can override or add to them here.

# Example additions for common developer-specific or temporary files:

# Configuration files
.env
.flaskenv
*.ini
*.cfg
settings.json
config.ini

# IDE/Editor temporary files
*.iml
*.iws
*.ipr
*.log

# Sensitive data or large files often found in development
logs/
uploads/
tmp/
var/
venv/
